# Freedom Arrow 0.7.0-dev.3 — development candidate

**This candidate carries forward dev.115 and changes XM30 to190 points with Bradley voice assignment. Install the companion combined asset pack0.1.3 for XM30 scale0.77 (10% larger than0.70) and the China music update.** No PLA test data is included.

## Defense correction from0.7 dev.1

The native loader selects only the first default ability row. Abrams X previously loaded APS alone; its smoke and ECM rows were separate defaults. XM30 smoke/APS already shared one row, but its ECM was separate. Both units now use one combined default profile. Latest instruction: Abrams X smoke1/APS2/ECM30%; XM30 smoke1/APS2/no ECM. IDs are preserved. Old separate profiles remain linked but non-default. Source/native-control-flow finding; not yet an in-game result.

## Changes from dev.115

- XM30:220 →190 points; same name, weapons, armor, defenses and availability.
- XM30 voice preset: T-15 → M2A3 Bradley. Abrams X retains the existing Abrams preset for the requested Crusader voice lines.
- Companion assets0.1.3: XM30 scale0.70 →0.77; China011 first in the menu, then remaining menu tracks; Mother Of All Weapons added to China battle music. New installs default to USA; existing playlist choice retained.
- Package display name corrected from the stale0.4 label to0.7.

## Carried forward

All other dev.115 data/settings are intended to remain unchanged, including40 mm damaging-artillery penetration floor, TOS damage11 with normal impact, JATM11 km and existing live added units. Su-75 availability remains2. Lateralus's queued branch is separate and is not silently included.

## Known issue and evidence limits

**This candidate corrects the identified first-default ability-selection bug: Abrams X and XM30 now each have one combined default defense profile; Abrams X has30% ECM and XM30 has none. In-game behavior still needs confirmation.** All claimed checks are offline package/data/compile or installer checks until a game result is explicitly recorded. Music playback, XM30 appearance and voice playback need runtime checks. Separate3-second TOS fire remains unimplemented.

## Install

Close the game. In BAModManager > Mods > + Add mods, import the gameplay0.7 candidate and the combined Models and Music0.1.3 pack, confirming replacement. Keep both enabled and ActualArrow disabled. Windows: manager PLAY. Linux: close manager and launch through Steam. A full restart is required. Do not import assets as the main gameplay modpack.
